# An Exploration of the Monsters and Munchkins Game
*By Harris Bubalo, Jamie Lin, Anna Yang, and Michael Huang*

This is the repo for our 'Monsters and Munchkins' Project, the final project to the CS2800 course at Northeastern University.

It contains:

* Our progress report
* Our final paper
* Our prototype of the algorithm in Racket (mainly for informal tinkering)
* Our final implementation of the algorithm in ACL2s, along with tests for correctness
* A text file with the pseudocode for the algorithm

# Setup
To view our algorithm and tests, open monsters-munchkins.lisp in Eclipse as we have typically done in class. If you are not/was not a CS2800 student, 
follow [these directions](https://pages.github.ccs.neu.edu/jhemann/21SP-CS2800/hw/hw1/#optional---local-acl2s-installation) to run ACL2s on your system. Once
you have Eclipse running, make sure to switch the ACL2s session mode to "ACL2s" in the ACL2s dropdown menu, and then start an ACL2s session (center-top button
with a green triangle) before tinkering with monsters-munchkins.lisp.
