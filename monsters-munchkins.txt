Monsters and Munchkins


Initial Conditions: There are any number of 'monsters' (M) and 'munchkins' (m) on the left and right side of a river.
There is a boat that can ferry a set maximum number (B) of  monsters and munchkins across, with a minimum of 1 passenger
(in order to row the boat). The boat always starts on the left side. The desired end state is  when all monsters and
munchkins are on the right side of the river. There is one condition: at any given time, there must be no more monsters
than munchkins  on any given side, and on the boat, unless there are no munchkins on that side or boat.

Starting Variables:
1. Number of Monsters on the left side
2. Number of Monsters on the right side
3. Number of Munchkins on the left side
4. Number of Munchkins on the right side
5. Boat maximum capacity

Ex. Starting State

M:4 m:4 [B:4] M:0 m:0 - (4 monsters and 4 munchkins starting on the left side of the river, and none on the right, with
max boat capacity of 4)


Traditional Algorithm Pseudo-code:
(Monsters and Munchkins start only on the left side, M = m, B = 4)

1. In the starting state,
	a. if M = m = 0, accept.
2. If there M+m <= B = 4, bring all passengers in one trip, then accept.
3. If m = 3
	a. bring 2 monsters and 2 munchkins to the right side
	b. bring 1 monster and 1 munchkin to the left side
	c. bring the rest to the right side
4. if m = 4
	a. while (!accept),
		i. bring 2 monsters and 2 munchkins to the right side.
		ii. bring 1 monster and 1 munchkin back to the left side.
5. If m > 4
	a. while (m > 4) on the left side,
		i. bring 2 monsters and 2 munchkins to the right side.
		ii. bring 1 monster and 1 munchkin back to the left side.
	b. move all of the remaining (m = 4) munchkins to the right side.
	c. while ( !accept ) on the left side
		i. bring 1 monster to the left side
		ii. bring maximum number monsters to the right side

Note:
For starting states M != m, if M > m, the problem is not solveable. If M < m, simply move 2 munchkins to the right side,
and 1 back to the left side, until M = m, and the boat is on the left side (ready to go to the right), and follow the
Traditional Algorithm.

Note:
It is trivial to imagine an algorithm for B > 4, as if it is possible with B = 4, simply
follow the same algorithm as if B = 4 anyways. For B < 4, the problem is impossible with 
M+m < B.
